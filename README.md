## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About the project

<p align="left" style="color: red;">Quiz Tango is a front-end application that I built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the QuizDB API. When you enter the app, you'll be prompted to choose your quizzes difficulty. After that, you can choose a category to have your knowledge be tested in! After which the quiz will start with a 60 second timer. Answer before the timer reaches 0! Rack up points for correct answer choices!</p>

## ü§î How to contribute

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ChrisMunozCodes/Quiz-Tango.git
```

**Follow the steps below**

```bash
0. Leave a comment on the issue you would like to work on.

1. Fork the original repository (top right corner next to watch and star buttons).

2. Under the dropdown menu from the button "code" copy the HTTPS link (from your forked repository) 'https://github.com/(your username)/Quiz-Tango.git'

3. In the place you want to clone the project, use git clone (your https link here).

4. Once you have the project open in VSCODE use 'git remote add upstream  https://github.com/ChrisMunozCodes/Quiz-Tango.git' in the terminal, this will track the main repository.

5. You can now use 'git fetch upstream' in the terminal to see a list of the different branches.

6. Use 'git checkout -b branch-name' replace branch-name with your branch. This will create a new branch for you to work within

7.. You can now use git add . & git commit -m '' 

8. Use 'git push -u origin a-descriptive-branch-name' replace a-descriptive-branch-name with your branch name (this will push all your code)

9. Now go back to your github and a button will appear that prompts you to make a pull request
```

## ü§î Features to add

1. User authentication
2. Database point storage using MongoDB & Mongoose instead of locally.
3. Versus mode, users can compete in quizzes in real time to see who can rack up more points.
